## Prevent duplicated remove vote

<[Pull Request 805](https://github.com/stock/stock-core/pull/805)>

When a staker removed a vote for a proposal or payment request, it keeps broadcasting the remove vote in every block instead of using the cache and broadcasting it only in one block.

Example: https://www.navexplorer.com/block/4987836

This PR fixes the behavior.

## Remove BLSCT verification benchmark logging

<[Pull Request 835](https://github.com/stock/stock-core/pull/835)>

## Use inventory for aggregation sessions and encrypted candidates

<[Pull Request 836](https://github.com/stock/stock-core/pull/836)>

This PR introduces a change in the way aggregation sessions and encrypted candidates are propagated.

Old model:

Nodes broadcast through dandelion (first using stem and later in fluff phase) the aggregation sessions and encrypted candidates in full to every node. Due to the size of encrypted candidates (2,6kb), this behaviour exhausts some nodes with low specs and reduces the performance of the wallet.

New model:

Nodes broadcast an INVENTORY message using Dandelion with the hashes (32 bytes) of the aggregation sessions and encrypted candidates they now. The node will request the item's data, only if it's unknown for them, hence reducing the computational overhead and traffic.

Notes:

Nodes running this version will not propagate to older versions, and won't receive from those. This change requires a majority of peers in the network to upgrade for a correct propagation of sessions and candidates.

## Protocol version 80021
