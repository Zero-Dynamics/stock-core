# Stock v6.0.1 Release Notes

## Tx structure memory optimisation

<[Pull Request 785](https://github.com/stock/stock-core/pull/785)>

This PR changes the memory structure of a transaction, storing the range proof as a vector instead of a BulletproofsRangeproof element when an output is not private. As the vector's size is 0 when no bulletproof is present, it allows to save the memory used by the range proof for a big part of the transaction history of the chain.

## Optimise sync speed

<[Pull Request 778](https://github.com/stock/stock-core/pull/778)>
